# Python comparison operators #  == < > <= >= !=
# Comparison operators are used to compare two or more values
x = 10
y = 5
z = 10

# Equal to ==
print(x==y) # False
print(x==z) # True

# Not Equal to !=
print(x!=y) # True
print(x!=z) # False

# Greater than >
print(x>y) # True
print(x>z) # False

# Less than <
print(y<z) # True
print(y<x) # True

# Grater than or equal to >=
print(y>=z) # False
print(x>=z) # True

# Less than or equal to <=
print(y<=z) # True
print(x<=z) # True

# Assignment Operator: = += -= *=
x = 7
x == y

x = 5
x += 10   # Same as x = x + 10
print(x)  # 15

# Typical shopping cart
total = 0
item_price = 49
total += item_price

print(total) # 49

# You can do same with -= and *=
