# Testing and Analysis Report: Infinite Fibonacci Room Adventure Game

## 1. Testing Overview
The Infinite Fibonacci Room Adventure Game underwent thorough testing to ensure functionality, user experience, and robustness. The testing process included unit testing for individual functions, integration testing for component interactions, and user testing to evaluate the overall game experience.

## 2. Modifications Made
Several modifications were made during the testing phase to enhance the game's performance and user interaction. Key modifications include:

- **High Score Feature:** Introduced a high score feature to add a competitive element and motivate players to achieve higher scores across multiple sessions.
    ```python
    # Global variable for high score
    high_score = 0
    ```

- **Display Improvements:** Enhanced the display of text, room descriptions, and choices to improve readability and user engagement.
    ```python
    # Function to print text with optional typing effect
    def type_text(text, delay=0.03, input_prompt=False, color=Colors.RESET):
        for char in text:
            print(color + char, end='', flush=True)
            time.sleep(delay)
        print(Colors.RESET)
        if input_prompt:
            return input()
    ```

- **Input Validation:** Implemented input validation to handle user input errors, ensuring the game prompts users to enter valid choices during gameplay and play-again prompts.
    ```python
    # Function to ask the player if they want to play again
    def play_again():
        while True:
            choice = type_text("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ", input_prompt=True).lower()
            if choice in ['yes', 'no']:
                return choice == 'yes'
            else:
                print("Invalid response. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")
    ```

- **User Feedback:** Incorporated additional feedback messages to inform players of their progress, choices, and outcomes, enhancing the overall user experience.
    ```python
    # Function to play the main game
    def play_game(difficulty):
        global high_score  # Access the global high score variable
        current_room = 1
        total_points = 0
        # Introduce a chance of discovering a hidden room based on difficulty
        if random.random() <= params['hidden_room_chance']:
            hidden_points = random.randint(*params['bonus_points_range'])
            type_text(f"You discovered a hidden room and earned {hidden_points} bonus points!", color=Colors.GREEN)
            total_points += hidden_points
    ```

## 3. Testing Results
The testing process yielded positive results with the game performing well in various scenarios. Key testing outcomes include:

- **Functionality:** All game functions, including room progression, point calculation, and high score tracking, performed as intended.
    ```python
    # Function to calculate Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            a, b = 0, 1
            for _ in range(n - 2):
                a, b = b, a + b
            return b
    ```

- **User Interaction:** User prompts and choices were clear, and the game responded appropriately to user inputs.
    ```python
    # Function to print text with optional typing effect
    def type_text(text, delay=0.03, input_prompt=False, color=Colors.RESET):
        for char in text:
            print(color + char, end='', flush=True)
            time.sleep(delay)
        print(Colors.RESET)
        if input_prompt:
            return input()
    ```

- **Randomization:** The randomization of hidden rooms, door orders, and point bonuses provided a dynamic and unpredictable gaming experience.
    ```python
    # Main game loop
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
        print(f"\nCurrent Room: {current_room}")
        print(f"Total Points: {total_points}")
        if random.random() <= params['hidden_room_chance']:
            hidden_points = random.randint(*params['bonus_points_range'])
            print(f"You discovered a hidden room and earned {hidden_points} bonus points!", color=Colors.GREEN)
            total_points += hidden_points
    ```

## 4. User Feedback
User feedback during testing was generally positive, with players enjoying the game's unique concept and the challenge of navigating through Fibonacci-themed rooms. Some suggestions for improvement included:

- **Visual Enhancements:** Players expressed interest in additional visual elements, such as graphics or animations, to complement the text-based gameplay.

- **More Hidden Features:** Users enjoyed discovering hidden rooms and suggested expanding on this concept with more diverse hidden features and challenges.

## 5. Future Improvements
Based on user feedback and testing results, potential future improvements could include:

- **Graphics and Animation:** Incorporating graphics and simple animations to enhance the visual appeal of the game.

- **Expanded Content:** Adding more room types, challenges, and hidden features to increase the game's depth and replayability.

- **Difficulty Levels:** Introducing difficulty levels to cater to both novice and experienced players.

## 6. Conclusion
